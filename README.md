GrooidShell: running scripts on Android
---------------------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/melix/grooidshell-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/melix/grooidshell-example)

This application demonstrates how classes can be generated at runtime and executed directly on an Android device. This application
is intended as an example only, and shows the advantages and limits of the concept.

Scripts are compiled on the device, then dexed in order to be converted to the Dalvik class format. Eventually, the script is executed.
